## Welcome to Project Quant Cat!
Cat is the best, cuz cat knows everything!

## About

### About Me
I'm currently a Private Wealth Advisor in Haitong Security co. in China. I've been self learning coding for many years and I mainly use TypeScript for my recent projects.

### About Python
I use python to build this project mainly because:
1. I'm learning Python since it's a popular and powerful language for quantitative financing.
2. Many useful tools and APIs I will use in this project may not support NodeJS :-(

### About This Project
I will build a program that generate one report in docx file each day for me, giving me as much information I want for financial decision making.
I'm so tired on searching and gathering information from the internet, cats can do it better!
I may develop 30-40 modules for different things, they may not be included in every report, they do only when necessary.
This is a developing projection and I will try my best keep this going in long run!
